However if you wish to implement it these are the steps 
### Steps
1. Enter your terminal and run the following commands
2. npm install
3. cd gs_hackathon/Framework/stock_market/Stock.js
4. npm start

### Additional Information
If you require anymore information on how to work the react app please view the README document in the stock_market file
